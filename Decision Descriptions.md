Decision Descriptions:

On 21th September, we had our first meeting with our customer Chris Galgon. After this face-to-face contact, we got the general idea about what kind of application he is anticipating.

As being a cameraman and a video editor at the same time, the cameras controlling and XML data accessing are both necessary for Chris. In the picture he images, there should be a stage and a few camera buttons on the screen. The camera buttons can be layout by him. The name of each camera will be editable and will also be displayed with the camera. XML data should be available when Chris is compiling the video.

The picture still seems vague. Then, we generated some questions for Christ to help us fill the idea:

	1. The size of the stage? do you want to edit or modify the size of the stage?
	2. Where do we save xml file? what should we do with if?
	3. Do you want a tool to nicely format the data in the xml files for easy viewing an PC?
	4. The most common number of the cameras? the max number of the cameras?

The response from Chris is very helpful and efficient:

	1. The size of the stage doesn't matter but should be small enough to accommodate all of the other icons. It would be nice to be able to move the stage.
	2. Anyway that exports the XML file would be satisfactory. If I can email it to myself, send it to dropbox, whatever can get that can get it to my Mac or PC.
	3. The XML document needs to play nice with Adobe Premier. I will essentially drag-and-drop the document into Premier, and then replace the W clips with the real ones. There is no reason I imagine ever looking at its contents.
	4. The most common number would be three, the maximum would be six or seven.

These answers help us have a better idea about what the functions our application should have. In the meantime, we also get accomplished our 8 user stories with these requirements.

Now, we already had the user stories, so the only job we need to do is rank them. It’s very hard to decide which one should be the first one. For example, I was insisted that the No.3 user story should be the most prioritized. But I was the only one who voted for No.3 user story, so the No.1 kept its imperial crown. It’s hard to decide which one is more important and prioritized than others, so, we tried the opposite way: figure out which one is the least important one. In every around, someone said out the least prioritized user stories and we voted for it together. We have 4 people in the group, so, only when 3 or 4 people voted for the user story, it counted, or we need another one. The number 5 – 8 went very smoothly, but number 1 – 4 was hard. For example, for the least important user stories of the last 4 ones, I thought it should be “having the time of selection recorded” and another group member considered it should be “output data about the times that each camera should be playing”. Luckily, other two people voted for “be able to click to select a camera”. Then we achieved an agreement. For the last three, we didn’t keep voting, instead, we discussed. It’s really hard to say which one is more important when there were only three user stories left and keep struggling with their essentiality is nothing but wasting time. So, we put more attention on the technology part: which one will be easy to implement. Then, we reached the consensus.

During this sprint, we didn’t really have face-to-face meeting a lot. Instead, we did the online group chatting. It’s hard to get four people together so online group chatting helps a lot. That’s actually very efficient and convenient, and we want to keep that. But one drawback is that we can’t make sure everyone can see the messages when something emergent happens.
