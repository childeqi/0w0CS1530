What I'm seeing here looks fantastic. I love that I can create or load a profile. 

Because it's early I have several suggestions. I have no idea what is "easy" and what is hard so take them as advice, not a mandate to change things.

1.) Change the word "narrow" to "Tight." Or the lens type could just be a text box.
2.) I would love to be able to set certain cameras as having a 30min. time limit. Some of my cameras are DSLR and can only record for that long. Therefore I would want to be able to set them up as running for only 30 minutes, perhaps with a warning starting at 25 minutes.
3.) Here are some things I told the other group the other day.
     a) Cameras could be represented as boxes (i.e. viewfinders) if that would be easier. 
     b) Whatever icon represents the cameras could be outlined in white when stopped, red when recording, and yellow if the camera has a 30min. limit and is nearing that limit.
     c) It would also help if each camera had its own timer counting up from when recording begins. (If cameras are represented by boxes, timer could be inside the box.)
     d) The stage does not need to be large. a skinny rectangle would do. It does not need to be draggable.

4.) It would help if I could delete a camera made by mistake.
5.) I would like the cameras to be represented spatially.
6.) Lens type could always just be another blank.
7. The photo feature (where we photograph the angle or lcd screen on the camera) is not necessary.

I'm attaching a suggested gui with everything I could want minus maybe lens-type (under the box, maybe). I can't know what's asking too much so of course use as much or little as you want.
