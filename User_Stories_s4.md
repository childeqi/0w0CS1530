#####(Sprint 4)

1. As a cameraman, I want each camera icon to be laid out as shown in "RT Video Editor Program Mockup.jpg" so that I have a familiar and easy-to-use interface.
2. As a cameraman, I want to be able to have multiple cameras recording at once so that the app reflects the state of the cameras in real life.
3. As a cameraman, I want to be able to mark a camera as 30 minute time-limited so that I can see how much more time I have before the camera runs out of space.
5.	As a cameraman, I want to be able to drag and drop camera icons so that I can place them anywhere I want.
6.	As a cameraman, I want there to be a stage icon so that I can use it as a reference for the position of the cameras.
7.  As a cameraman, I want the button that allows the current recording session to finish to require a double click so that I do not accidentally end the recording session.
8.  As a video editor, I want the XML that is output by the app to be loadable by Adobe Premiere so that I never need to look at raw XML.
9.  As a video editor, I want the XML file that is output to be easily transferable from the phone/tablet to my computer so that I can access it easily when it is time to use it.
10.  As a cameraman, I want to be able to delete cameras so that I can remove cameras created by mistake.
11.  As a cameraman, I want to be able to delete saved configurations so that I can prevent an accumulation of configurations that are no longer needed.
