##Customer Response:

We are trying our best to follow the picture that the customer draw for us last time. (see “RT Video Editor Program Mockup.jpg”)
And, after we sent the customer what we had, here is the response:

I think it looks amazing! I have been thinking about what you guys suggested regarding double taps, or confirmations, if that trashcan means that I would throw away any record of that camera, I'll need to have to do more then a usual tap to make it go away. Also I would cram a couple horizontal lines into the tab box it was you pull it around. That's what I'm used to it looking like it I think it will make it look more complete. Once again, excellent job!

From the response we can see that what we are doing is in the correct direction. After we had a hard time of solving the coding problem, the response cheered us up a lot. We are happy that we are doing is right. 

But we haven’t sent the customer the well-tested version yet. We are going to make more touch with the customer later when our interface looks better.
