##Customer Response:

When we got the basic GUI done, we thought that was the time to get the feedback from the customer. His comments can let us know if we are drawing the correct picture. Instead of just sending the Github link, we also sent the screenshots showing him how the software works.

From the perspective of the customer, he likes that he can create or load a profile. So, generally, he is satisfied with what we are having for the project. 
Although he has no idea about the easiness of actualization, here are the things that he wants to be modified:

	1. Change the word "narrow" to "Tight." Or the lens type could just be a text box.
	2. I would love to be able to set certain cameras as having a 30min. time limit. 
	   Some of my cameras are DSLR and can only record for that long. 
	   Therefore I would want to be able to set them up as running for only 30 minutes, 
	   perhaps with a warning starting at 25 minutes.
	3. Here are some things I told the other group the other day.
	     a) Cameras could be represented as boxes (i.e. viewfinders) if that would be easier. 
	     b) Whatever icon represents the cameras could be outlined in white when stopped, 
		red when recording, and yellow if the camera has a 30min. limit and is nearing that limit.
	     c) It would also help if each camera had its own timer counting up from when recording begins. 
		(If cameras are represented by boxes, timer could be inside the box.)
	     d) The stage does not need to be large. a skinny rectangle would do. 
		It does not need to be draggable.
	4. It would help if I could delete a camera made by mistake.
	5. I would like the cameras to be represented spatially.
	6. Lens type could always just be another blank.
	7. The photo feature (where we photograph the angle or lcd screen on the camera) is not necessary.

Also, he sent a picture of the suggested GUI for us.

When we got all these feedback, we were happy and upset at the same time: We were happy about that he was generally liked what we had and we had a very clear direction to go now. We were upset because some of the requirements may be hard to implement for us and we needed to figure out the parts we could handle with. Even though the customer said, “I can’t know what’s asking too much so of course use as much or little as you want.” all those things are truly showing what he needs the application to do.
