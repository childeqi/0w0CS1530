1. As a cameraman, I want to be able to somehow select a camera and have the time of selection recorded so that I can later use this time information when editing the video.
2. As a video editor, I want the app to output XML data about the times that each camera should be playing so that I can then later use these times when I am compiling the video.
3. As a cameraman, I want to be able to layout multiple cameras and a stage on the app so that they correspond with the real-life recording environment.
4. As a cameraman, I want to be able to click to select a camera that is graphically laid out so that it is easy to visualize the selected camera. 
5. As a video editor, I want the XML that is output by the app to be loadable by Adobe Premiere so that I never need to look at raw XML.
6. As a video editor, I want the XML file that is output to be easily transferable from the phone/tablet to my computer so that I can access it easily when it is time to use it.
7. As a cameraman, I want to assign each camera a name to be displayed with the camera so that I can identify each camera on screen.
8. As a cameraman, I want to be able to add notes to each camera while filming, so I can use this information later when editing the video.
8. As a cameraman, I want to be able to set each camera as either wide or narrow lens and have the area in sight of the camera reflect this setting so that I can easily identify when a camera should have a subject in view.
