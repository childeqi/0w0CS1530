##Description of Sprint

#####
#####
#####Team communication:
From the experience we got from last Sprint, we think online group chat is the most convenient way to communicate. We had two face-to-face meetings at the beginning. In the first one, the project manager had a talk with everyone individually to make sure everyone knew what to do. After several days, we met together again and talked about whether we needed any changes in our user stories or just keep on going based on the process of our developers. After those two meeting, we did all the communication through online group chat because we already have the generally legible direction we need.

#####Challenges of coding:
Actually, our developers don’t have experience with Android development. So it does take time. It is always the first step that is troublesome. So is learning a new programming language. How to add an icon? How to load a new picture? How to save the data? …… There were plenty of things they need to learn how to handle with. 

#####
#####
#####Solutions:
Although we really need time to learn how to deal with Android development part, our logic and structure are good. With the correct logic and structure, and the growing understanding of Android GUI, we realized that some of our user stories needed to be tuned. Some of the original user stories are kind of vague and big. So, some of them should be split into smaller and more elementary steps.

#####User Stories Changing:
######New user stories:
        1.	As a cameraman, I want to be able to save my configurations.
        2.	As a cameraman, I want to be able to load my configurations.
        3.	As a cameraman, I want to be able to add multiple cameras.
        4.	As a cameraman, I want each of my cameras is given an actual camera shaped icon, which make them easy to be identified.
        5.	As a cameraman, I want to assign each camera a name to be displayed with the camera so that I can identify each camera on screen.
        6.	As a cameraman, I want my camera icons can be moved so that I can place them anywhere I want.
        7.	As a cameraman, I want to be able to add a stage with a stage icon.
        8.	As a cameraman, I want the stage icon can be moved so that the stage and the cameras correspond with the real-life recording environment.
        9.	As a cameraman, I want to be able to somehow select a camera and have the time of selection recorded so that I can later use this time information when editing the video.
        10.	As a video editor, I want the app to output XML data about the times that each camera should be playing so that I can then later use these times when I am compiling the video.
        11.	As a cameraman, I want to be able to set each camera as either wide or narrow lens.
        12.	As a cameraman, I want to be able have the area in sight of the camera reflect its setting so that I can easily identify when a camera should have a subject in view.

#####Others:
An interesting fact is: the new ordered user stories are very different from the old ones that we got before we were really dealing with the challenges of the Android GUI. The more we learn about the Android GUI, the better we understand the user stories. When we are working with the GUI, we are actually performing as a developer and a user at the same time. At the time we are trying to put the ideal functions into reality, we are realizing that that every single function actually has more steps than we thought. The changes of our user stories surprised us. At the same time, however, it’s the proof of our deliberation of the application.
