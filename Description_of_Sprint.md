##Description of Sprint

#####Team communication:
For this final deliverable, we had one face-to-face meeting in the middle. Online group chat worked very well as before, but we think that face-to-face meeting is also important especially for this time: the changes of the user stories make our process very slow and talking with each other actually helps a lot. Some ideas that never showed up in online chatting actually came out when we were talking with each other in the meeting.

#####Challenges of coding:
After that huge change of our user stories, we had a hard time. Most user stories are related: when you can figure out one, you can get all of them done; but if you don’t, you get stuck. We were really stuck in the beginning. For the entire first week, we didn’t get any movement even we worked a lot, which made us really upset. One of our developers just got familiar with Android, and the other one just started working on front-end. So, for them, these user stories are tough. 
We had a hard time, but we came over it. Now, we have most of the user stories done.

#####User Stories Changing:
New user stories:
1. As a cameraman, I want each camera icon to be laid out as shown in "RT Video Editor Program Mockup.jpg" so that I have a familiar and easy-to-use interface.
2. As a cameraman, I want to be able to have multiple cameras recording at once so that the app reflects the state of the cameras in real life.
3. As a cameraman, I want to be able to mark a camera as 30 minute time-limited so that I can see how much more time I have before the camera runs out of space.
4.	As a cameraman, I want to be able to drag and drop camera icons so that I can place them anywhere I want.
5.	As a cameraman, I want there to be a stage icon so that I can use it as a reference for the position of the cameras.
6.  As a cameraman, I want the button that allows the current recording session to finish to require a double click so that I do not accidentally end the recording session.
7.  As a video editor, I want the XML that is output by the app to be loadable by Adobe Premiere so that I never need to look at raw XML.
8.  As a video editor, I want the XML file that is output to be easily transferable from the phone/tablet to my computer so that I can access it easily when it is time to use it.
9.  As a cameraman, I want to be able to delete cameras so that I can remove cameras created by mistake.
10.  As a cameraman, I want to be able to delete saved configurations so that I can prevent an accumulation of configurations that are no longer needed.
