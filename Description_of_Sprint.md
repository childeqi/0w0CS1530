##Description of Sprint

#####
#####
#####Team communication:
This time, we didn’t have a chance to meet together. Our group members were kind of busy and it’s hard to find a good meeting time for everyone. So, we met separately to talk about what we need to do in the beginning of this sprint. Then, we worked independently and reported in the online group chat as what we did in other sprints.

#####
#####Challenges of coding:
After we got the feedback from the customer in the end of last sprint, we found that there were a lot of changes needed to be done in this time. The biggest change, also the most important one, the interface. From the picture the customer draw for us, we need some camera icon. These icons are more than simple pictures that only make the interface looks cuter; they are also showing the states of the cameras. Different colors of the borders and the filled parts represent distinct states. For example, when the border is white, the camera is not recording, the red border means it’s recording, and the yellow one means that a 30min-limited camera is almost out of time. 
The interface is not the only thing we need to change. From the details the customer offered, we also made some changes in our user stories.

#####Problems and Solutions:
This time, one accident happened: one of our developers, his Android Studio was freezing every time while rendering. That made us upset and really slowed our process down. Although he figured out why it’s freezing, we already lost a lot of time and we couldn’t finish all the user stories we planned in the beginning of this sprint.

#####User Stories Changing:
######New user stories:
1. As a cameraman, I want each camera icon to be laid out as shown in "RT Video Editor Program Mockup.jpg" so that I have a familiar and easy-to-use interface.
2. As a cameraman, I want to be able to have multiple cameras recording at once so that the app reflects the state of the cameras in real life.
3. As a cameraman, I want to be able to mark a camera as 30 minute time-limited so that I can see how much more time I have before the camera runs out of space.
4.	As a cameraman, I want to be able to drag and drop camera icons so that I can place them anywhere I want.
5.	As a cameraman, I want there to be a stage icon so that I can use it as a reference for the position of the cameras.
6.  As a cameraman, I want the button that allows the current recording session to finish to require a double click so that I do not accidentally end the recording session.
7.  As a video editor, I want the XML that is output by the app to be loadable by Adobe Premiere so that I never need to look at raw XML.
8.  As a video editor, I want the XML file that is output to be easily transferable from the phone/tablet to my computer so that I can access it easily when it is time to use it.
9.  As a cameraman, I want to be able to delete cameras so that I can remove cameras created by mistake.
10.  As a cameraman, I want to be able to delete saved configurations so that I can prevent an accumulation of configurations that are no longer needed.

#####Interactions with customer:
While working with the camera icons and trying to figure the functions, we told him about what confused us. After the communication, the picture of what the application should look like become clear. In addition, the customer likes the new interface we have now and we are happy about that.
