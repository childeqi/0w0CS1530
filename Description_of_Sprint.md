##Description of Sprint

#####
#####
#####Team communication:
As what we did for last sprint, we still use online group chat as the most frequent way to communicate. We also had face-to-face meeting once at the beginning of this sprint to discuss about the user stories and their orders, and make sure that everyone knows what they need to do. After we got our basic direction and legible goal, working separately is more convenient for us. Every time when we had some processes, we would talk about that in our group chat.

#####
#####Challenges of coding:
Our developers are still getting familiar with Android. So, during the process of developing, there were plenty of things waiting for them.
One big problem we got is: when we were trying to make saving the configurations work, how to use the XML library became a challenge. We were also having some problem with the hardware acceleration for the Android emulator and running anything is slow.  

#####
#####
#####Solutions:
Time is almighty. It takes time to get familiar with Android and its libraries. It takes time to figure out the way to solve the real-time problem. It takes time to make everything working without bugs. It takes time. 
Also, the communication between the two developers helps a lot; they were sharing their experience and helping with each other.

#####User Stories Changing:
######New user stories:
		1.	As a cameraman, I want to be able to save my configurations.
		2.	As a cameraman, I want to be able to load my configurations.
		3.	As a cameraman, I want to be able choose to load a configuration or create a new one.
		4.	As a cameraman, I want each of my cameras is given an actual camera shaped icon, 
			which make them easy to be identified.
		5.	As a cameraman, I want my camera icons can be moved so that I can place them anywhere 
			I want.
		6.	As a cameraman, I want to be able to add a stage with a stage icon.
		7.	As a cameraman, I want the stage icon to be movable so that the stage and the cameras 
			correspond with the real-life recording environment.
		8. 	As a video editor, I want the XML that is output by the app to be loadable by Adobe 
			Premiere so that I never need to look at raw XML.
		9. 	As a video editor, I want the XML file that is output to be easily transferable from the 
			phone/tablet to my computer so that I can access it easily when it is time to use it.
		10.	As a cameraman, I want to be able to add notes to each camera while filming, so I can use
			this information later when editing the video.
		11.	As a cameraman, I want to be able have the area in sight of the camera reflect its 
			setting so that I can easily identify when a camera should have a subject in view.

#####Interactions with customer:
After we got our basic GUI done, we sent the link to the customer. The customer doesnâ€™t really know how to use Github, so, we also sent him the screenshots, which are showing all the functions we have. Before we really showing him these, everything was above the clouds and seemed very nice for both of our sides. But now, both of us have a clearer picture about what the product should be. The customer changed some requirements and also added some. And we think that we may have a huge change about our user stories in next sprint.
