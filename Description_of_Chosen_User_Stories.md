Description of Chosen User Stories:
(Details of Why Those User Stories are Chosen)

After the communication with the customer for last deliverable, we realize that a huge change of our interface need to be done. Our customer showed us a picture of the interface that he imaged, which was very different from what we already had. Also, after we show him the functions we already had, he gave us more details about what he actually wanted. So, the user stores changed a lot. During our meeting, we all agreed that the interface is the most important thing for us in this deliverable.

For the new interface, we need a camera icon, which is described as our User Story 1. It’s not just a simple icon; it the base of other functions. The colors of the camera icon will show the different states of cameras. Although we haven’t really done other functions, we can’t do anything without the camera icon. That is the reason we choose this user story.

Other user story we choose id user story 8. As we already have the User Story 7, it will make more sense to do User Story 8 earlier than other background user stories.
