##Description of Chosen User Stories:
######(Details of Why Those User Stories are Chosen)

In this deliverable, we are supposed to finish all the user stories. Also, due to the big change of user stories, at the beginning of this deliverable, there are 8 user stories waiting for us, which is a really big challenge for the developers and tester.

What can we do in two weeks? What can we achieve in two weeks? Do as much as we can.

We find that user stories 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9 are sharing similarities. Also, they are all talking about how the camera icons should look like in different conditions. So, these user stories make up the basic layout of the interface we want. Thus, if we can make as many of them as we can first, we can say that our application has a good shape. 

In addition, because our user stories are ordered, we were following the order when we were working on them. Obviously, without user story one, none of other user stories are possible. User story 2 and 3 are related and 2 is much more important than 3. User story 4 is a very hard one, but itâ€™s important for user. So, we give it priority and make it before user story 9 though user story 9 is much easier.
